This gives an implementation of fcntl for non nix users.
If you require this within your dependencies, please have it exclude environments with a real and useful fcntl.

If you work for or can help influence Python to provide this out of the box. Please do, the current error sucks!

Installation
============

```shell
pip install fcntl
```
